You will need to constrain your row/column loops so that only the pixels within the triangle are drawn on the screen - you may get some strange results if you try to draw pixels outside of this triangular area ! (Why not try it if you want to see what happens)

Note that the `vec2` and `vec3` objects from the GLM library support a range of privative mathematical operators - so you can, for example, multiply a `vec2` by a float and get a scaled `vec2` as a result; or add two `vec2` objects together. This makes performing `vec2` operations a lot easier (since you don't need to perform operations on `x` then `y` components separately).
