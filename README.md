Weekly workbooks will be published in <a href="Weekly%20Workbooks/">this folder</a> 
each week during the first 8 weeks of term. Check back regularly to see 
what is new. The easiest way to download these materials is to clone the repo
(then do a pull each week in order to get the new material).
You should keep pace with the release of these workbooks (don't leave 
everything until the end of term !)
